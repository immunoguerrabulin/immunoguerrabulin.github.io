I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Chemistry at the University of Chicago, where I develop atomistic models for ion pumps. My research focuses on using computational techniques to study P-type ATPase pumps.

My work combines molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations to study complex biological systems. 

Feel free to reach out via email at JLGuerra@uchicago.edu for collaborations or discussions about computational chemistry and molecular modeling.
