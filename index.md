I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Chemistry at the University of Chicago, where I develop atomistic and machine learning models for ion pumps and molecular systems. My research focuses on understanding ion transport mechanisms and applying computational methods to drug discovery.

My work combines molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanics calculations, and machine learning approaches to study complex biological systems. I am particularly interested in membrane proteins, ion channels, and their role in cellular processes.

Feel free to reach out via email at JLGuerra@uchicago.edu for collaborations or discussions about computational chemistry and molecular modeling.t: about
